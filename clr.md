### 1. Types of Problems in Nature

- **Iteration:**  
  Iterative approaches involve repeating tasks or steps until a condition is met.  
  - **Example Applications:** Managing schedules, calculating factorials using loops.  
  - **Advantages:** Easy to understand and implement for repetitive tasks.  
  - **Limitations:** May become inefficient for highly complex problems.  

- **Recursion:**  
  Recursion solves problems by breaking them into smaller instances of the same problem, often using a base case for termination.  
  - **Example Applications:** Fractals, Tower of Hanoi, Divide and Conquer algorithms.  
  - **Advantages:** Reduces code complexity for self-similar problems.  
  - **Limitations:** May cause stack overflow or excessive memory usage without proper optimization.  

- **Backtracking:**  
  Backtracking involves exploring possible solutions and retracting steps when a solution path fails.  
  - **Example Applications:** Solving mazes, N-Queens problem, Sudoku.  
  - **Advantages:** Systematically finds solutions for constraint-based problems.  
  - **Limitations:** Computationally expensive for large problem spaces.

### 2. Space and Time Efficiency

- **Time Efficiency:**  
  Measures how fast an algorithm executes. Growth is analyzed using Big-O notation.  
  - **Examples:** O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n²), etc.  

- **Space Efficiency:**  
  Focuses on minimizing memory usage during execution.  
  - **Trade-off:** Often, faster algorithms require more space (e.g., dynamic programming).  

- **Growth Orders:**  
  Big-O notation describes how runtime or space grows with input size.  
  - **Key Classes:** Constant (O(1)), Logarithmic (O(log n)), Linear (O(n)), Quadratic (O(n²)), Exponential (O(2ⁿ)).

### 3. Design Principles

- **Divide and Conquer:**  
  Break a problem into smaller subproblems, solve each recursively, and combine results.  
  - **Example Applications:** Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search.  

- **Greedy Algorithms:**  
  Make locally optimal choices to find a global optimum.  
  - **Example Applications:** Kruskal’s Algorithm, Huffman Coding, Fractional Knapsack Problem.  

- **Dynamic Programming:**  
  Solve problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing intermediate results.  
  - **Example Applications:** Fibonacci numbers, Longest Common Subsequence, Matrix Chain Multiplication.

### 4. Hierarchical Data & Tree Structures

- **Common Trees:**  
  - Binary Search Tree (BST): For efficient search, insertion, and deletion.  
  - AVL Tree: A balanced BST to ensure O(log n) operations.  
  - Red-Black Tree: Another balanced BST with simplified rebalancing rules.  
  - Heap: Used in priority queues.  
  - Trie: Efficiently stores strings for search operations like autocomplete.  

- **Applications:**  
  Optimize search, insertion, and memory usage based on data structure choice.

### 6. Tree vs. Graph and Traversals

- **Tree vs. Graph:**  
  - Tree: Hierarchical, no cycles.  
  - Graph: More complex, may include cycles and multiple relationships.  

- **Traversals:**  
  - **Tree:** In-order, Pre-order, Post-order.  
  - **Graph:** Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS).  

- **Applications:**  
  Navigating file systems, social networks, and road maps.

### 7. Sorting and Searching Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms:**  
  - Quick Sort: Efficient in practice, O(n log n) on average.  
  - Merge Sort: Stable and divides the array recursively.  
  - Applications: Database indexing, event scheduling.  

- **Searching Algorithms:**  
  - Binary Search: Quickly find an element in sorted data, O(log n).  
  - Applications: Large datasets, lookup operations.

### 8. Graph Algorithms

- **Spanning Trees:**  
  - **Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms:** Kruskal’s and Prim’s.  
  - Applications: Network design (e.g., telecommunications, electrical grids).  

- **Shortest Paths:**  
  - **Algorithms:** Dijkstra’s (greedy), Bellman-Ford (handles negative weights).  
  - Applications: GPS navigation, internet routing.

### 9. Algorithm Design Techniques

- **Brute Force:**  
  Try all possible solutions; straightforward but inefficient.  
  - **Example:** Checking all subsets for a solution.  

- **Greedy:**  
  Select the best option at every step.  
  - **Example:** Activity selection problem.  

- **Divide and Conquer:**  
  Divide the problem, conquer each part, combine results.  
  - **Example:** Merge Sort.  

- **Dynamic Programming:**  
  Store solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.  
  - **Example:** Longest Palindromic Substring.  

- **Backtracking:**  
  Explore all possibilities and backtrack if a solution doesn’t work.  
  - **Example:** Solving Sudoku.
